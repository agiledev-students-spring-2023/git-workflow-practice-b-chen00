# [Will AI take over Web Design?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-take-over-web-design-irving-gil/)

## What I found interesting

With the recent popularity of ChatGPT and AI in general, I think it is important to keep in mind how it will impact the future of software engineering and web design. ChatGPT could generate working code when given a prompt in many different languages which is astonishing. AI in general is more capable than a human in terms of speed, accuracy, and consistency like the article said. However, I highly doubt it will completely automate away software engineering jobs agree with the points made by the article.

I think rather AI will instead enhance or streamline the work done by software engineers. AI will definitely be able to create a whole application in the future but there will be a need to talor or customize that application even further. AI will serve to produce the prototype or foundations of an application which will emphasize the need to plan, maintain, and update. Overall, I think in the future software engineers will have to improve upon and customize existing sites rather than build sites from scratch. In fact, most software engineering work are contributions to a working code base already so there might not even be much of a difference at all.

## Comment (Jiahong Jiang jj3005)
Ai is definitely more efficient and accessible than human web designers, but unlike human designers, it's hard for AI to fully understand the exact requirements of clients, and the adjustment of AI generated contents are not easy for clients to adjust by themselves, which make the existence of human designers indispensible. However, I agree that AI would take over most of the basic works of web design, and leave the complex, thought-needed contents for human designers.
